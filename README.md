# Elections-Ad-Spending-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes election advertising spending and its potential correlation with voter turnout across different states and constituencies. Using Python and Plotly, it visualizes data from various sources to identify trends and insights regarding political ad expenditures and voter participation.
If you are highly active on Facebook and Instagram, you must have seen ads based on elections by any of the political parties, especially **BJP** and **INC**. All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Meta ads about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian election 2024 in each state.
